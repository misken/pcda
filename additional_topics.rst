Additional topics for new Advanced Analytics w/Python course
============================================================

In Summer I, 2021 (May-June), I offered a new special topics 
course called Advanced Analytics with 
Python (ST: MIS 4900/6900). I've been wanting to do this for a while as the number of 
topics that I want to cover in the Practical Computing for Data 
Analytics course keeps growing but the number of weeks in a semester 
does not. The topics covered the first time I taught this were:

- predictive modeling with scikit-learn (we barely touch on this in pcda class)
- advanced regression modeling (lasso, ridge, and friends)
- using Excel and Python together
- datetime and occupancy analysis
- web scraping
- interactive data viz
- simulation modeling with Python
- various software engineering topics relevant to analytics work
