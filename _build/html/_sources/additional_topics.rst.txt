Additional topics for new Advanced Analytics w/Python course
============================================================

In Summer I, 2021 (May-June), I started offering a new special topics 
course called Advanced Analytics with 
Python (ST: MIS 4900/6900). I've been wanting to do this for a while as the number of 
topics that I want to cover in the Practical Computing for Data 
Analytics course keeps growing but the number of weeks in a semester 
does not. The topics covered are:

- predictive modeling with scikit-learn (we barely touch on this in pcda class)
- advanced regression modeling (lasso, ridge, and friends)
- using Excel and Python together
- datetime and occupancy analysis
- web scraping
- interactive data viz
- simulation modeling with Python
- geocomputation with Python
- various software engineering topics relevant to analytics work

There are some topics that everyone does and then you get to choose from the others based on your interests.

You can find the course website at:
