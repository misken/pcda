Intro to the bash shell
***********************************

Intro and Objectives
====================

You will learn how to use the bash shell - a very common command line
interface on Linux systems. Why learn the bash shell?

* Many Linux tasks rely on you being a competent bash shell user
* Massive efficiency and productvity gains possible using bash
* Gets you closer to the computer and increases your technical sophistication
* Reinforces notion of functional decomposition - little programs that do one thing well

You will learn to use the bash shell to do (among other things):

* navigation through the file and folder structure on your computer
* file and folder manipulation (create, delete, move, copy)
* run programs
* get information about your computer system
* use pipes and filters to accomplish file management tasks by combining multiple shell commands
   
Readings
========

* `Tech Support Cheat Sheet <https://xkcd.com/627/>`_

* Read Sections 1-4 of the Software Carpentry tutorial entitled: `The Unix Shell <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_

.. note::

	In the "Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous..." tutorial, there are two nice boxes describing the `"magic of computers" <https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#aside-computer_magic>`_ and `"technical sophistication" <https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#aside-technical_sophistication>`_. READ THEM.

[OPTIONAL] A few more Linux shell tutorials that I have found useful are:

* `Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous <https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial>`_
* `Linux Tutorial from Ryan's Tutorials <https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/>`_
* `Unix Tutorial for Beginners <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/>`_

Activities
================================

We will use the presentation slides (in the Downloads) to guide our discussion and hands-on 
exercises to learn the basics of using the bash shell.

What is the bash shell?
-----------------------

- `SCREENCAST: Intro to bash shell <https://youtu.be/d7SPECZCfo4>`_ (6:12)

An example from a research project
----------------------------------

- `SCREENCAST: The CELLDEX project <https://youtu.be/qIuCzJxXEro>`_ (5:17)

File management
--------------------------------

Understanding how the file system is laid out and to do things
like navigating the folder tree, name files, copy/move/delete 
files and directories.

- `SCREENCAST: File management <https://youtu.be/KIuKXDj5CdU>`_ (21:16)


Combining commands to explore and manipulate files
--------------------------------------------------

Use pipes, redirection and filters to accomplish file management tasks by combining multiple shell commands

- `SCREENCAST: Combine shell commands to do useful things <https://youtu.be/jGTMmMGErXg>`_ (10:09)


A few more useful bash commands
--------------------------------------------------

Learn how to use bash to edit files, search files, grab data from websites. Also, where to go to learn more and solutions to the challenges.

- `SCREENCAST: Some additional useful bash commands <https://youtu.be/7R4wEsbVi4M>`_ (15:48)

[OPTIONAL] Intro to Shell for Data Science course at DataCamp
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using DataCamp for the Classroom in my class, you also have access to the following course:

* `Intro to Shell for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science>`_

Sections 1-3 cover very similar ground as done in my screencasts. Subsequent sections go a bit further and
get into shell variables and basic shell scripting. It's interactive and an efficient intro the bash shell.
