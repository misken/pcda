MIS 5470 - Practical Computing for Data Analytics
=================================================

This is an open access version of most of the content of the [Practical Computing for Data Analytics](https://pcda.misken.org/) course I teach at [Oakland University](). It is NAMOOC (NOT a massively open online course) - it's simply a way of sharing content and course structure ideas. My courses have benefited greatly from the resources and knowledge shared by many in the teaching community. This is my way of giving back.
